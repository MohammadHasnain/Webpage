<p style="font-size:30px;"> <strong> Why are movies important?</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li>Movies reflect a culture in so many ways. Think about the messages <br> of your favorite  movies and how those messages have influenced you. <br> In this way, film reflects culture For example, a movie  that calls for <br> forgiveness will resonate with people who <br> forgive,but not with people who don’t forgive.</li>
    <li>Movies also change culture by influencing the beliefs, opinions, and <br> behaviors of the  people who see them. For example, a documentary about <br> child abuse may move you to take action against child abuse in your own <br> community, whether by volunteering for an <br> organization or donating money. This is how films change a culture.</li>
    <li>Movies promote economic growth by creating jobs for thousands of people <br> from all walks  of life and by generating billions of dollars in revenue <br> each year that’s returned to  the economy through taxes and other <br> expenditures on goods and services related to film <br> production (e.g., construction workers building a set).
</li>
